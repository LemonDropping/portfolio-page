                <p>Hi there! My name is Cole Roberts and welcome to my website!
                    I was born in Houston, TX and still call it home. I graduated The 
                    Savannah College of Art and Design with a Bachelors in Animation.
                    However, I am pivoting my career to become a web developer and a software
                    engineer. Feel free to contact me about my work or any other inquiries.  
                </p>
